      <h3 style="color:white;">Harry Potter</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">If Harry were a more self-centred person he'd probably object to placing third on his own list, but since the Boy Who Lived tends to err on the side of modesty, we're guessing he'd simply confine himself to horror that he placed above so many valued friends and teachers. That's perhaps the most likeable thing about Harry: despite the attention lavished on him by the entire wizarding world, he remains more conscious of his failings than his successes, and doesn't let it all go to his head. In Daniel Radcliffe's hands, the boy wizard grows up smart, reserved and quietly, fiercely loyal to his friends and ideals. Despite carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and a sense of incipient doom in his heart, he stays determined throughout the series. For that steadfastness and courage, he'll always be our hero.</p>
    </div>

      <img src="https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/62a9389825617.560dab7c82a68.jpg" alt="Ron Weasley" style="max-width:100%;height:50vh">
      <h3 style="color:white;">Ron Weasley</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">The heart and funny bone of the central trio, Ron provides the lion's share of laughs over the course of the Potter books – and we love him for it. But there's more to him than that. His relationship with Harry is not simply one of best friends, but a complex mix of love and envy. After all, while Harry envies Ron his large, loving family, Ron has to contend with his middle-child syndrome, and must contrast his own threadbare lifestyle with Harry's wealth. There's even a time when they seem to be rivals for Hermione's affection (at least in Ron's mind), and it's no wonder that there's tension there. But we love Ron because he always comes right in the end, abandoning resentment for affection and standing by both his blood family and surrogate family.</p>

      <h3 style="color:white;">Hermoine Granger</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Hermione may start the Harry Potter films as an insufferable know-it-all, but she finishes them as an entirely sufferable, even loveable, know-it-all, someone who doesn't hide her smarts but also gives the people around her credit for intelligence as well. Her friendship with Harry and Ron rubs off Hermione's rougher edges, while age and suffering transform her into someone tactful. And, lest we forget, they wouldn't get far without her problem-solving and research abilities, not to mention her quick responses to danger (consider that hex she throws at Harry when they're chased by Snatchers in Deathly Hallows: Part 1). JK Rowling apparently gave her character an unusual name because she was afraid that children would get teased if they shared a moniker with Hogwarts' school swot. By this time, however, we're pretty sure that the name Hermione is a badge of honour rather than a cause of ridicule, because it turns out that the girl in the gang is maybe the most capable of the lot.</p>

      <h3 style="color:white;">Severus Snape</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Alan Rickman was the only person other than JK Rowling to know, from the start, where Severus Snape’s story was going. He had to, because Snape is a puzzle-box of a character, layering secrets and riddles over a heart that remains hidden until the very end. Let's face it: even the sneering, supercilious outermost layer is a delight to behold, Rickman's distinctive delivery squeezing malice out of every word. Then there's his shocking turn in Half-Blood Prince lashing out at Dumbledore, the one man who always had faith in him – and his ultimate redemption in Deathly Hallows Part 2, revealing his tragic backstory and lifelong commitment to Harry, Dumbledore, and, most importantly, Lily Potter. It's this slow revelation of unguessed-at complexity that has put the school's most bullying teacher in the top spot on this list, in a testament both to Rowling's writing and Rickman's endless capacity for snark. We can only stand in wonder, and salute their efforts.</p>

      <h3 style="color:white;">Sirius Blake</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">In the absence of an actual father, Sirius Black is Harry's next best thing. Like a member of the A-Team, he's a crack wizard sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit. 12 years later, he escaped a maximum security, Dementor-guarded stockade to the wizarding world underground. After that, still wanted by the Ministry of Magic and Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters, he survived as a wizard of fortune. If you're an orphaned wizard boy, if no other godfather dogfather can help, and if you can find him, maybe you can hire... Sirius Black. Er, that got away from us a little there. The point is, Sirius is a wonderfully flawed character, combining an entitled arrogance and tendency to recklessness with an immense capacity for affection – all of which he lavishes on Harry, who badly needs it.</p>

      <h3 style="color:white;">Remus Lupin</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Almost the first thing that Professor Lupin does onscreen is to hand out squares of chocolate, so it's really very little wonder that he's popular. Oh sure, the chocolate's medicinal and he's just gotten rid of a terrifying Dementor, which is nice too, but our affections can always be bought with confectionary. It's really just a bonus that he turns out to be one of the most sensible and stalwart characters in the series, an ideal sort of teacher whose Defence Against The Dark Arts lessons are a rare example of that class not being a total waste of time and who brings out the best in all his students. In his later appearances, he's an upstanding member of the Order of the Phoenix, who defeats Lucius Malfoy in the Department of Mysteries and helps Harry escape to safety in Deathly Hallows: Part 1. As werewolves go, he's definitely at the loveable end of the scale, between Jacob Black and Teen Wolf, rather than down with the Howling gang and Fenrir Greyback.</p>

      <h3 style="color:white;">Albus Dumbledore</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Like Gandalf with a sweet tooth, Albus Dumbledore is wise but also not above helping out short-arses. In his case that's 11 year-olds rather than hobbits, but the object – defeating a great and looming evil – remains the same. As wise as he is bearded, as eccentric as he is powerful and as fond of sherbet lemons as any man who ever lived, Dumbledore is a father figure and mentor to Harry – but one who isn't slow about sending him into mortal peril when the occasion calls for it. He has made a few errors of judgment in his time – his record on hiring Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers is, shall we say, patchy – but he did foresee much of what transpired. And while he may not be able to choose a Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Bean without going wrong, we can hope that his faith in people will be borne out.</p>

      <h3 style="color:white;">Neville Longbottom</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">The whole Harry Potter saga was kicked off because of a prophecy that Voldemort would be done in by a newborn wizarding infant. Ol' Dark Lord picked on one of the two infants that was "mixed blood" and went after Harry Potter – and the rest, as they say, is massively bestselling fiction. He could as easily have chosen to target the “pure blood” Neville Longbottom, son of two powerful Aurors and future gosh-darn hero. Overshadowed by Potter, Neville had a rocky, bullied start in life, suffering clumsiness and a spotty magical ability crippled by his own insecurities. However, he blossoms during his time at Hogwarts, winning Gryffindor the House cup in his first year, joining (and eventually leading) Dumbledore's Army, and becoming a rebel leader against the school authorities. Also, he grows up well handsome, so well done him. Frankly, there's a small part of us that would almost like to have read an entire series named after this guy instead of Potter.</p>

      <h4 style="text-transform:uppercase;color:white;"><b>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</b></h4>
      <h6 style="color:white;"><i>&quot;It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.&quot;</i></h6>
      <p style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Late one night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, along with the school's groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, deliver a recently orphaned infant named Harry Potter to his only remaining relatives, the Dursleys. Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointing life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to Diagon Alley to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past: Harry's parents James and Lily Potter died due to a Killing Curse at the hands of the malevolent and all-powerful wizard: Lord Voldemort. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived".
        <br><br>
        Harry enters the King's Cross station to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets three other students: Ron Weasley, whom he quickly befriends; Hermione Granger, an intelligent witch born to Muggle parents; and Draco Malfoy, a boy from a wealthy wizarding family, with whom he immediately forms a rivalry. After arriving at school the students assemble in the Great Hall, where all the first-years are sorted by the Sorting Hat among four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Although the Sorting Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin with Draco, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside with Ron and Hermione.
        <br><br>
        At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and parents. After recovering the Remembrall of Gryffindor student Neville Longbottom, Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's Quidditch team as a Seeker, an extremely rare feat for rookie students. On their way to the dorms one night the stair cases change paths leading Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the forbidden floor of Hogwarts. The three discover a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron then insults Hermione after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson, causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is attacked by a marauding troll, but Harry and Ron save her, befriending her in the process.
        <br><br>
        The children later find out that Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, an object that has the power to turn any metal into gold and produce a potion that grants immortality. Harry suspects that Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House Severus Snape is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape does. They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of safeguards, including a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys that bruise Harry, and a giant chess game that knocks out Ron.
        <br><br>
        After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Quirinus Quirrell who was trying to claim the stone: Snape had actually been protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry in response; however, he is instead killed after Harry ends up burning his skin, reducing Quirrell to dust and causing Voldemort's soul to rise from his ashes. Harry is knocked unconscious in the process.
        <br><br>
        Harry recovers in the school's hospital wing with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: When Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville for attempting to stop the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.</p>

      <h4 style="text-transform:uppercase;color:white;"><b>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</b></h4>
      <h6 style="color:white;"><i>&quot;It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.&quot;</i></h6>
      <p style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Harry Potter spends the summer with the Dursleys without receiving letters from his Hogwarts friends. In his room, Harry meets Dobby, a house-elf who warns him of a peril that will take shape if he returns to Hogwarts. Dobby reveals that he intercepted his friends' letters, and ruins an important dinner for the Dursley’s, who lock Harry up and prevent his return to Hogwarts. Harry’s friend Ron Weasley and his older twin brothers, Fred and George, rescue him in their father's flying Ford Anglia.
        <br><br>
        While purchasing school supplies, Harry and the Weasley family encounter Rubeus Hagrid and Hermione Granger. They attend a book-signing by celebrity wizard Gilderoy Lockhart, who announces that he will be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. During a small confrontation with Draco Malfoy, Harry meets Malfoy's father, Lucius, who discreetly slips a book into Ginny Weasley's belongings, which only Harry notices, but he mentions this to no one. When Harry and Ron are blocked from entering Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at London King's Cross railway station, they fly to Hogwarts in the flying car. They crash into the Whomping Willow upon arrival, and Ron's wand is broken. Both boys narrowly avoid expulsion when Professor McGonagall gives them detention.
        <br><br>
        During the detention, Harry hears strange voices and later finds caretaker Argus Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, petrified, along with a message written in blood announcing "the Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware". McGonagall explains that one of Hogwarts' founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber. He placed a monster inside that only his Heir can control, capable of purging the school of muggle-born students. Harry and Ron suspect Malfoy as the Heir, so Hermione suggests they question him while disguised using the forbidden polyjuice potion. They utilise a disused bathroom haunted by a ghost, Moaning Myrtle, as their makeshift laboratory to brew the potion.
        <br><br>
        During a Quidditch game, Harry's arm is broken by a Bludger. He is then visited by Dobby in the infirmary, who tells Harry that he both closed the portal to Platform 9 3/4 and made the Bludger chase after Harry, in an attempt to get Harry to leave the school. When Harry communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the Heir. On Christmas Day, Harry and Ron learn that Malfoy is not the Heir, but Malfoy mentions his father told him that a muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened fifty years ago. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by former Hogwarts student Tom Riddle, which contains a flashback fifty years prior where Riddle accused Hagrid, then a student, of opening the Chamber. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. Professor Dumbledore, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, and Lucius come to take Hagrid to Azkaban, but he discreetly tells the boys to "follow the spiders". In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid's giant pet spider, Aragog, who reveals Hagrid's innocence and provides them a small clue about the Chamber's monster.
        <br><br>
        A book page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a basilisk, a giant serpent that instantly kills those that make direct eye contact with it; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff learn that Ginny was taken into the Chamber, and convince Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart, who is exposed as a fraud, planning to flee; knowing Myrtle was the girl the Basilisk killed, they take him to the bathroom and find the Chamber's entrance. Once inside, Lockhart uses Ron's broken wand against them, but it backfires, wipes his memory, and causes a cave-in.
        <br><br>
        Harry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle. Riddle reveals that he used the diary to manipulate Ginny and reopen the Chamber. When Riddle creates the anagram for his future new identity, "I am Lord Voldemort", Harry realises that Riddle himself is Slytherin's heir and Voldemort's true identity. After Harry expresses his loyalty to Dumbledore, Fawkes flies in with the Sorting Hat, causing Riddle to summon the Basilisk. Fawkes blinds the Basilisk, allowing Harry to look at it directly without being killed or petrified. The Sorting Hat eventually produces the Sword of Gryffindor, with which Harry battles and slays the Basilisk, though he is injured by one of its fangs.
        <br><br>
        Harry defeats Riddle and revives Ginny by stabbing the diary with the basilisk fang. Fawkes's tears heal him, and he returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. Dumbledore praises them and orders Hagrid's release. Dumbledore shows Harry the sword he wielded was Godric Gryffindor's own sword, and says he is different from Voldemort because he chose Gryffindor instead of Slytherin. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby's master, of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron, and tricks him into freeing Dobby. The Basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban.</p>
