      <h3 style="color: white;">Ginny Weasley</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Ginny sort of sneaks up on you – which is pretty much the same effect she has on Harry. Initially, she's your typical younger sister, clamouring for attention but then fading shyly away when anyone actually gives it. She goes through hell in the Chamber of Secrets, and emerges a more formidable woman than ever. Probably in self-defence (imagine living with her older brothers for a moment) she's already a heck of a witch before she ever gets to Hogwarts, impressing even Fred and George with her "bat-bogey hexes". So she's certainly a worthy match for the Boy Who Lived, even if it does take him forever to figure that out. In the films, she has to make the first move, with Harry forever dithering about whether to hit on his best mate's sister. While she isn't onscreen much, Bonnie Wright gives Ginny just enough gumption to make an impact even among the sprawling Weasley brood.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Professor Minerva McGonagall</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Second only to Dumbledore in providing a sense of security and refuge at Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall may appear the strict disciplinarian and dry old stick, but there's life in the old girl yet. Consider, if you will, how excited she gets when she realises that Harry is a born Seeker and just what Gryffindor's Quidditch team needs, in the very first film. She's clearly enough of a sports fan to let him get away with unauthorised flying, which may not be morally sound but is certainly good news for Harry. And for her protective side, consider her confrontation with the odious Professor Umbridge in Order of the Phoenix – and she really gets to let loose in Deathly Hallows: Part 2. In Hogwarts’ darkest hour, she's the one rallying the troops and planning the war effort, and there isn't a Cuban cigar or a bulldog in sight.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">He limps, he's only got one eye, he's a fully-functional paranoid and he could kindly be described as curmudgeonly. The fact that he's also one of the most powerful Aurors out there, and that even someone doing an impression of Mad-Eye is still one of the best Defence Against The Dark Arts teachers Hogwarts has ever had arguably says a lot about the competition. Says actor Brendan Gleeson, “I see him as a formidable warrior who is somewhat past his best, but who is battle-hardened and can still be effective. He has learned the hard way that life can be unforgiving and is impatient of namby-pamby half-measures, particularly among the kids. He knows they must be at their best to survive. He's Mr. Tough Love with a vengeance. I don't think he was without genuine affection for them, though, He'd never admit it, of course.”</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Fred and George Weasley</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">While our three heroes fumbled and stumbled about at Hogwarts, trying to decide what their futures held, the Weasley twins had the luxury of knowing their passion: pranks, gags and gaffes. While everyone else fretted over their exams, Ron's older brothers had an entrepreneur's eye and a magician's mirth. Having always been on hand to help Harry out in tough situations, the brave brothers were auspiciously born on April Fool's.The more they pestered and prodded at Ron, the more we realized that they were the kind of older brothers that we all would have wanted to grow up with. Taking umbrage at Umbridge and leaving Hogwarts with a bang in Order of the Phoenix showed us that these two weren't just goofy side-splitters; they were brave and valiant freedom fighters. And Fred would pay the ultimate price for that spirit eventually.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Molly Weasley</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">For most of the Potter series, Molly Weasley has two simple functions: providing maternal love and support to, well, just about everyone, and worrying about, well, just about everyone. While Harry has several surrogate fathers – Hagrid, Dumbledore, Sirius, Lupin and Mr Weasley – he has only one surrogate mother, and that's Molly. But she also stands in that stead to seven children of her own, and Hermione, to some degree, and Tonks. Still, she's not just a mummy figure. In the final book, we get an emphatic reminder that Mrs Weasley is a considerable witch in her own right, and more than capable of bringing the hurt when called upon to do so. Just because someone is red-haired, a bit dumpy or fond of cardigans, it doesn't mean they can't kick ass. There's a valuable lesson there for us all.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Nymphadora Tonks</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">While Natalia Tena makes for a likeable Tonks onscreen, the character’s popularity is more for her role in the books. After all, she's barely in the movies, whereas on the page we learn a little more about her family (excised from the Black family and targeted by Bellatrix!), her romance (Tonks and Remus, sitting in a tree...) and her personality, acting like a cool older sister to Harry and the gang. Amid a forest of tweed-enthusiasts and robe-wearers, Tonks' colour-changing hair, ripped jeans and T-shirts (she's a fan of popular wizarding band Weird Sisters) give the series a rare edge, and that can only be a good thing. After all, even wizards have to rock out sometimes, right? And if that comes inbetween being a Metamorphmagus and taking on Death Eaters, so much the better.</p>

      <img src="https://media.harrypotterfanzone.com/gilderoy-lockhart-chamber-of-secrets-portrait-3.jpg" alt="Gilderoy Lockhart" style="width:100%;height:50vh">
      <h3 style="color: white;">Gilderoy Lockhart</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">You know, we'd really like to read the job adverts that Hogwarts publishes for the Defence Against The Dark Arts teaching post. Do they actually say, “Must keep secrets. Big, dark, dangerous secrets preferred; treachery an advantage”? Because that would explain a lot. It would explain, for instance, how this vain, empty-headed blowhard managed to get what is – presumably – a prestigious post. All preening arrogance, fancy threads and far-fetched claims, Lockhart is a comic wonder and a rotten little sneak at the same time, especially as wonderfully brought to life by Kenneth Branagh, vaulting neatly over the top and swishing his hair as he goes. He provides, on our count, a good 75% of the humour in the film – not least because you can't help laughing as soon as you look at him. One question though: why on Earth did the usually-wise, usually-insightful Dumbledore hire him in the first place? Apparently Lockhart was the only applicant – but that hardly seems like sufficient excuse.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Cedric Diggory</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">He was selected as the Hogwarts Triwizard Champion and, although overshadowed in the press by the entry of Harry Potter, Cedric enjoyed almost overwhelming support from the student body, and after the first two tasks, tied with Harry for first place. Cedric and Harry completed the Third Task together. Both took hold of the Triwizard Cup, which transported them to the Little Hangleton graveyard. In the graveyard, Cedric was murdered by Peter Pettigrew with the Killing Curse, on the order of Lord Voldemort.</p>

      <h4 style="text-transform:uppercase;color: white;"><b>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</b></h4>
      <h6 style="color: white;"><i>&quot;Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.&quot;</i></h6>
      <p style="text-align:justify;color: white;">During another summer with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter is expelled from Hogwarts after he uses magic to save himself and Dudley Dursley from Dementors. Harry is whisked off by a group of wizards including Mad-Eye Moody, Remus Lupin and several new faces including Nymphadora Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the home of his godfather Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore which informs Harry that the Ministry of Magic is refusing to believe Lord Voldemort's return. At the Order's headquarters, Sirius mentions that Voldemort is after a special object he did not have during his previous attack.
        <br><br>
        Harry's expulsion is reversed at a hearing of the Ministry of Magic and he returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year, where Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor: Dolores Umbridge. Umbridge immediately clashes with Harry and punishes him for his "lies" about Voldemort by forcing him to write a message with a magic quill, scarring his hand. Despite the concern of his best friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, Harry refuses to report Umbridge's punishment to Dumbledore, who has mysteriously been ignoring Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Harry, Hermione and Ron form a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves "Dumbledore's Army". Umbridge tasks the Slytherin students with exposing the group, forming the "Inquisitorial Squad". Meanwhile, Harry and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other.
        <br><br>
        Harry has a vision involving an attack upon Arthur Weasley, from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs Severus Snape to give Harry Occlumency lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. This causes Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Sirius' deranged Death Eater cousin Bellatrix Lestrange escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her "Inquisitorial Squad" expose Dumbledore's Army by forcing Cho to drink Veritaserum. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.
        <br><br>
        Harry's refusal to forgive Cho causes their relationship to fall apart. The Occlumency lessons end after Harry discovers through Snape's memories that Harry's father, James, often ridiculed him. After seeing another vision where Sirius is tortured by Voldemort, Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network but are caught by her. Through cryptic language, Harry alerts Snape of the situation, who in turn alerts The Order. When Umbridge threatens to use the Cruciatus Curse on Harry, Hermione tricks her into entering the Forbidden Forest in search of Dumbledore's "secret weapon". Hermione and Harry lead Umbridge to the hiding place of Rubeus Hagrid's giant half-brother Grawp, only to be confronted by centaurs who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks and insults them.
        <br><br>
        Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny Weasley, Luna Lovegood, and Neville Longbottom fly to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals in an attempt to save Sirius. The six enter the Department of Mysteries and uncover a bottled prophecy, the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured, which served as a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, causing a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters.
        <br><br>
        The Death Eaters capture Harry's friends, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy. As Harry obliges, the Order arrive and attack the Death Eaters. This causes Lucius to drop the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, he is killed by Bellatrix. Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before he can kill Harry. A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues, during which Bellatrix escapes. At an impasse with Dumbledore, Voldemort possesses Harry to tempt Dumbledore into sacrificing him but Harry, thinking of his friends and Sirius, manages to block Voldemort from his body.
        <br><br>
        Ministry officials arrive right before Voldemort disapparates; Fudge admits Voldemort's return and resigns as minister in disgrace. Umbridge is removed from Hogwarts, and Dumbledore returns as headmaster. Dumbledore explains that he distanced himself from Harry throughout the year, hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort using their connection. Harry comes to terms with the prophecy: "Neither can live while the other survives."</p>

      <h4 style="text-transform:uppercase;color: white;"><b>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</b></h4>
      <h6 style="color: white;"><i>&quot;It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.&quot;</i></h6>
      <p style="text-align:justify;color: white;">Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, kidnapping wand-maker Garrick Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.
        <br><br>
        Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy. Harry is found and saved by Luna Lovegood.
        <br><br>
        At Hogwarts, Harry and Ron borrow textbooks for Slughorn's Potions class, and Harry is stuck with a copy that turns out to be filled with helpful notes and spells left by the "Half-Blood Prince". Harry uses the book to excel in the class and impresses Slughorn, winning a Liquid Luck potion. Ron becomes Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team and forms a romantic relationship with Lavender Brown, upsetting Hermione. Harry consoles Hermione and admits that he now has feelings for Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley.
        <br><br>
        Harry spends the Christmas holidays with the Weasleys. On Christmas Eve, Harry discusses his suspicions about Draco to the Order of the Phoenix. His suspicions are dismissed, but Arthur Weasley later tells Harry privately that the Malfoys may have been interested in a Vanishing Cabinet. Bellatrix and Greyback attack and burn down the Burrow, drawing Harry into a battle. He saves Ginny before the Order arrives and fight off the Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore reveals to Harry that Slughorn possesses a memory of Voldemort that Dumbledore desperately needs. He asks Harry to confront Slughorn and retrieve the real memory, after being given an altered version that made it appear as though Slughorn did not know anything. Harry is unable to convince Slughorn.
        <br><br>
        After Ron accidentally ingests a love potion intended for Harry, Harry cures him with Slughorn's help. The trio celebrate with mead that Slughorn had intended to gift to Dumbledore. The mead poisons Ron, and Harry is forced to save his life after Slughorn hesitates. Ron murmurs Hermione's name while recovering in the infirmary, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the mead and a cursed necklace, and the two duel. Harry uses a curse from the Half-Blood Prince's potion book to severely injure Malfoy, who is rescued and healed by Snape. Fearing the book may be filled with more Dark Magic, Ginny and Harry hide it in the Room of Requirement and share their first kiss.
        <br><br>
        Harry decides to use his Liquid Luck potion to convince Slughorn to give up the memory Dumbledore needs. Harry views the memory with Dumbledore and learns that Voldemort wanted information for creating Horcruxes, magical objects that could contain pieces of a wizard's soul and make them immortal. Dumbledore concludes that Voldemort successfully divided his soul into seven pieces by creating six Horcruxes, two of which have already been destroyed: Tom Riddle's diary by Harry and Marvolo Gaunt's ring by him. The two travel to a seaside cave where Harry aids Dumbledore in drinking a potion that hides another Horcrux, Slytherin's locket.
        <br><br>
        A weakened Dumbledore defends them from Inferi and apparates back to Hogwarts. Bellatrix, Greyback, and other Death Eaters enter Hogwarts with Draco's help through the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement that Draco managed to connect to the one he had been working on in Knockturn Alley. Dumbledore instructs Harry to talk to Snape and no one else. Draco arrives in the Astronomy Tower and disarms Dumbledore revealing that he has been chosen by Voldemort to kill the headmaster. Harry is hiding below. Snape arrives, and casts the killing curse on Dumbledore when Draco is unable to bring himself to do it, killing the Headmaster. He later overpowers Harry and reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince before escaping with the Death Eaters.
        <br><br>
        Harry returns to Hogwarts, where the students and staff mourn Dumbledore's death. He later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from "R.A.B.", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it. As they decide to forgo their final year at Hogwarts Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide to track down the remaining Horcruxes together.</p>
