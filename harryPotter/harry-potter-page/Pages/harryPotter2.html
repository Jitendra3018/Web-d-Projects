      <h3 style="color: white;">Dobby</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Dobby is basically the worm that turned, the little guy who finds the courage and the opportunity to stand up to his oppressors and win himself a place in the world. His life under the Malfoys must have been brutal (as he says to Harry, “Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home”) but it's a crucible that transforms him into a radical elf, one who becomes a veritable hero and a credit to his kind. He may look like E.T.'s scrawnier brother, and sound like Yoda on helium, but in his heart he's a giant. Without him, Harry would have died ten times over – maybe the series should have a different title. Dobby's death at the end of Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is one of the most sob-inducing moment of the series, a valiant farewell fitting for a tiny, tattered warrior.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Lord Voldemort</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">It would be hard to argue that Voldemort is anyone's favourite character – except maybe Bellatrix’s – but he's certainly one of the best. Through flashbacks and memories, we see him grow from lonely orphan to the monster he becomes, psychotic and loveless. Voldemort's obsessed with living forever – and ensuring that whatever steps he takes to do are invulnerable to interference from outside – but it's hard to see what he has to live for, since his existence seems to be either miserable or fixated on the aforementioned mission. If he'd focused his life on keeping his nose and hair, and maybe not sparking two Wizarding Wars, he might've been happier. Then again, if he had done that, we would have been deprived of one of the great villains, who announced his rebirth by ordering the death of Him From Twilight and went on to terrorise a nation.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Rubeus Hagrid</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">He's big, he's tough, and he has the soft heart of a 10 year-old girl. Only instead of being soppy about ponies or puppies or the colour pink, Hagrid's a rollover for dragons, giant spiders, three-headed monster dogs and giant meat-eating death-horses. Hagrid is not, it's fair to say, the most discrete character, leaking secrets like a rusty sieve, nor the wisest, failing to foresee the problems that cropped up during his early tenure as Hogwarts' Professor for Care of Magical Creatures. However, he is perhaps the warmest, making no effort to hide how much he cares for his friends (and pets) and with that big sentimental streak always just under the surface.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Luna Lovegood</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Life would be so boring if everyone was on the same page. You need the weirdos, the kooks and the borderline barmy to spice things up – and by that measure Luna Lovegood is a veritable spice girl, bringing a touch of much-needed unconventionality to Hogwarts' halls. Merely casting spells or flying about on broomsticks is never going to get you noticed there, but wear a few pairs of radish earrings or talk about Nargles a bit and suddenly everyone thinks you're odd. Still, we're glad of Luna. She's a deeply smart and caring character, even if she does tend to show it by wafting about in silly glasses, and she has both the guts and the gall to stand beside Harry even in his darkest hours. That's to be commended – even if there's a part of us that wishes she'd worn her gigantic papier-mache lion headdress to do so.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Bellatrix Lestrange</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">In the books, Bellatrix is stern, nasty and seriously scary. On screen, as brought to life by an off-the-leash Helena Bonham-Carter, she's as good a baddie as you could ever wish to see. Sadistic, borderline demented and hopelessly devoted to Voldemort, she is as charmingly childish as she is terrifyingly unrestrained. Revelling in torture and death, one can't help but feel that she follows Voldemort largely because he lets her indulge in her favourite hobbies. This is, let's not forget, a woman who tortured Neville Longbottom's parents into insanity, as well as torturing Neville himself and Hermione, and who killed Sirius Black and later Tonks out of some twisted sense of family loyalty. She's utterly, utterly evil and somehow we love her for it. "She's just like this mad child, and she's very high-octane, just utterly anarchic," says Bonham-Carter of her take on the character. "Now she's so unhinged she's just lost.”</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Draco Malfoy</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Here's a walking argument for nurture vs. nature. Draco, it slowly emerges through the Potter series, is not all bad. Sure, he's an obnoxious, racist, twisted little creep with all the personal magnetism of a Boggart, but it's more the result of having the worst influences money can buy. While his mother is at least (over) protective, his father is a dreadful role-model – but even he is better than Auntie Bellatrix and the Death Eaters that his father hangs out with. It's no wonder that Draco grows into a bullying little twit; the real surprise is that underneath there's a spark of decency. It feels like Draco's attracted to the whole Death Eater / "pure blood" philosophy, but doesn't quite have the stomach for the brutality that goes with it – which is, we suppose, as much as one can hope for in this case. There is, incidentally, a faint argument that Draco ultimately saves the day, and certainly he plays an unwitting role in Voldemort's downfall – but we'd still give him a wedgie if we ever got the chance.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Lucius Malfoy</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Some bad guys have more fun than others. While Voldemort's busy securing himself eternal life and Umbridge spends her time buying more plates with kittens on, Lucius Malfoy gets to slink around being arch and snide and generally amusing. He gets the best house, the best outfits and of course the silkiest, shiniest, most thoroughly-Timotei'ed hair. Sadly for him, it all goes a bit pear-shaped as the series goes on. He is arrested after the Battle of the Department Of Mysteries and sent to Azkaban, from which he emerges a broken man and a shadow of his former self. Soon Voldemort's kicking him, Bellatrix is ignoring him and even his bullied son Draco is finally standing up to Daddy. From then, it's snivelling all the way. We can only hope he appreciates that his wife, Narcissa, has the balls to step up and lead the family while he whimpers.</p>

      <h3 style="color: white;">Dolores Umbridge</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;color:white;">Voldemort's pretty evil and all, but he's a mere rapscallion compared to the thoroughly grotesque Dolores Umbridge. Party apparatchik, twin-set wearer and cat person, she's unquestionably the nastiest woman ever to wear pink tweed and a nightmare teacher in every way. Sent to Hogwarts by the Ministry of Magic to counter Dumbledore and Harry's claims that Voldemort has returned, she soon tightens her grip on the school and turns it into a totalitarian state. The terrifying thing about her is the strength of her conviction in her own righteousness and her total lack of self-doubt. It's that certainty that leads her to use unforgiveable curses at will – sure that she knows better than the law – and that certainty that justifies torture in pursuit of the elusive order she's pursuing. There has never been a woman more in need of being terrorised by centaurs or imprisoned for life in Azkaban, if you ask us.</p>

      <h4 style="text-transform:uppercase;color: white;"><b>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</b></h4>
      <h6 style="color:white;"><i>&quot;Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.&quot;</i></h6>
      <p style="text-align:justify;color: white;">Harry Potter awakens from a nightmare wherein a man named Frank Bryce is killed after overhearing Lord Voldemort conspiring with Peter Pettigrew and another man. While Harry attends the Quidditch World Cup match between Ireland and Bulgaria with the Weasleys and Hermione, Death Eaters terrorise the camp, and the man who appeared in Harry's dream summons the Dark Mark.
        <br><br>
        At Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore introduces ex-Auror Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He also announces that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament, in which three magical schools compete across three challenges. Only wizards aged seventeen and above may compete. The Goblet of Fire selects "champions" to take part in the competition: Cedric Diggory of Hufflepuff representing Hogwarts, Viktor Krum representing the Durmstrang Institute from Eastern Europe, and Fleur Delacour representing the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic from France. The Goblet unexpectedly selects Harry as a fourth champion. Dumbledore is unable to pull the underage Harry out of the tournament, as Ministry official Barty Crouch Sr. insists the champions are bound by a contract after being selected.
        <br><br>
        For the first task, each champion must retrieve a golden egg guarded by a dragon. Harry succeeds in retrieving his egg, which contains information about the second challenge. Shortly after, a formal dance event known as the Yule Ball takes place; Harry and Ron attend with Parvati and Padma Patil, Harry's crush Cho Chang attends with Cedric, and Hermione attends with Viktor, making Ron jealous. The second task involves the champions diving underwater to rescue someone valuable to them. Harry finishes third, but is promoted to second behind Cedric due to his "moral fibre", after saving Fleur's sister Gabrielle as well as Ron. Afterwards, Harry discovers the corpse of Crouch Sr. in the forest. While waiting for Dumbledore in his office, Harry discovers a Pensieve, which holds Dumbledore's memories. Harry witnesses a trial in which Igor Karkaroff confesses to the Ministry of Magic names of other Death Eaters after Voldemort's defeat. When he names Severus Snape, Dumbledore vouches for Snape's innocence; Snape turned spy against Voldemort before the latter's downfall. After Karkaroff names Barty Crouch Jr., a devastated Crouch Sr. imprisons his son in Azkaban. Exiting the Pensieve, Harry realizes that Crouch Jr. is the man he saw in his dream.
        <br><br>
        For the final task, the champions must reach the Triwizard Cup, located in a hedge maze. After Fleur and Viktor are incapacitated, Harry and Cedric reach the cup together. The two together grab the cup, which turns out to be a Portkey and transports them to a graveyard where Pettigrew and Voldemort are waiting. Pettigrew kills Cedric with the Killing Curse and performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters. Voldemort releases Harry and challenges him to a duel to prove he is the better wizard. Harry tries the Expelliarmus charm to block Voldemort's attempted Killing Curse. The beams from their wands entwine and Voldemort's wand disgorges the last spells it performed. The spirits of the people he murdered are seen in the graveyard: Cedric, Frank Bryce, and Harry's parents. This distracts Voldemort and his Death Eaters, allowing Harry to use the Portkey to escape with Cedric's body.
        <br><br>
        Harry tells Dumbledore that Voldemort returned and killed Cedric. Moody takes Harry back to his office to interrogate him about Voldemort, inadvertently blowing his cover when he asks Harry about a graveyard, despite Harry not mentioning a graveyard. Moody reveals that he submitted Harry's name to the Goblet of Fire and manipulated Harry to ensure he would win the tournament. Moody attempts to attack Harry, but Dumbledore, Snape, and Minerva McGonagall subdue him. The teachers force Moody to drink Veritaserum, and he reveals that the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk as his Polyjuice Potion wears off. He is revealed as Crouch Jr. and returned to Azkaban.
        <br><br>
        Dumbledore reveals to the students that Voldemort killed Cedric, although the Ministry of Magic opposes the revelation. Dumbledore later visits Harry in his dormitory, apologizing to him for the dangers he endured. Harry reveals that he saw his parents in the graveyard; Dumbledore names this effect as "Priori Incantatem". Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons bid farewell to each other.</p>

      <h4 style="text-transform:uppercase;color: white;"><b>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</b></h4>
      <h6 style="color:white;"><i>&quot;Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.&quot;</i></h6>
      <p style="text-align:justify;color: white;">Harry Potter has been spending another dissatisfying summer with the Dursleys. When Aunt Marge Dursley insults his parents, he loses his temper and accidentally causes her to inflate like a balloon and float away. Fed up, Harry then flees the Dursleys with his luggage. The Knight Bus arrives and takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where he is pardoned by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge for using magic outside of Hogwarts. After reuniting with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns that Sirius Black, a convicted supporter of the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban prison and intends to kill him.
        <br><br>
        The trio return to Hogwarts for the school year on the Hogwarts Express, only for dementors to suddenly board the train, searching for Sirius. One enters the trio's compartment, causing Harry to pass out, but new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin repels the dementor with a Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that dementors will be guarding the school while Sirius is at large. Hogwarts groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher; his first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the hippogriff Buckbeak, who attacks him. Draco exaggerates his injury, and his father Lucius Malfoy later has Buckbeak sentenced to death.
        <br><br>
        The Fat Lady's portrait, which guards the Gryffindor quarters, is found ruined and empty. Terrified and hiding in another painting, she tells Dumbledore that Sirius has entered the castle. During a stormy Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, dementors attack Harry, causing him to fall off his broomstick. At Hogsmeade, Harry is shocked to learn that not only had Sirius been his father's best friend and apparently betrayed them to Voldemort, but is also Harry's godfather. Lupin privately teaches Harry to defend himself against dementors, using the Patronus Charm.
        <br><br>
        After Harry, Ron, and Hermione witness Buckbeak's execution, Ron's pet rat Scabbers bites him and escapes. When Ron gives chase, a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the Whomping Willow's base. This leads the trio to an underground passage to the Shrieking Shack, where they discover that the dog is actually Sirius, who is an Animagus. Lupin arrives and embraces Sirius as an old friend. He admits to being a werewolf, and explains that Sirius is innocent. Sirius was falsely accused of betraying the Potters to Voldemort, as well as murdering twelve Muggles and their mutual friend, Peter Pettigrew. It is revealed that Scabbers is actually Pettigrew, an Animagus who betrayed the Potters and committed the murders.
        <br><br>
        Severus Snape arrives to apprehend Black but Harry knocks him unconscious with the Expelliarmus charm. After forcing Pettigrew back into human form, Lupin and Sirius prepare to kill him, but Harry convinces them to turn Pettigrew over to the dementors.
        <br><br>
        As the group departs, the full moon rises and Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Sirius transforms into his dog form to fight him off. In the midst of the chaos, Pettigrew transforms back into a rat and escapes. Harry and Sirius are attacked by dementors, and Harry sees a figure in the distance save them by casting a powerful Patronus spell. He believes the mysterious figure is his deceased father before passing out. He awakens to discover that Sirius has been captured and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss.
        <br><br>
        Acting on Dumbledore's advice, Harry and Hermione travel back in time with Hermione's Time Turner, and watch themselves and Ron repeat the night's events. They save Buckbeak from execution and witness the Dementors overpower Harry and Sirius. The present Harry realises that it was actually him who conjured the Patronus, and does so again. Harry and Hermione rescue Sirius, who escapes with Buckbeak. Exposed as a werewolf, Lupin resigns from teaching to prevent an uproar from parents. He also returns the Marauder's Map to Harry, as he no longer has the authority to confiscate contraband. Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt broom, and he happily takes it for a ride.</p>
