    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Marvel Studios, LLC (originally known as Marvel Films from 1993 to 1996) is an American film and television studio that is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios. Marvel Studios is known for the production of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics publications.
      <br>
      Marvel Studios has released 23 films since 2008 within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from Iron Man (2008) to Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). These films all share continuity with each other, along with the One-Shots produced by the studio and the television shows produced by Marvel Television.
